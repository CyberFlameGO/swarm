		<h1>Section VIII, Kiosk Mode</h1>
		
		<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		<b>Swarm</b> can be used as a <i>much</i> lower cost, more functional replacement to the traditional helicorder by using its Kiosk Mode.
		In Kiosk Mode <b>Swarm</b> displays all of the open helicorders in full-screen mode.  This make seismic monitoring as easy as a glance 
		at the screen while still allowing the standard helicorder zooming.  Of course, if you want to look at other stations
		or use the <a href="sectionVI.html">Wave Clipboard</a> you can just leave Kiosk Mode. F11 toggles between Kiosk Mode and normal operation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Because there are no menus or toolbars when in Kiosk Mode you'll have to use keyboard shortcuts to interact with the inset wave view.  Or,
		just switch to normal mode.
		</p>
		
		<a name="setup"><h2>Configuring Automatic Kiosk Mode</h2>
		<p><b>Swarm</b> can be automatically start in Kiosk Mode by running it with the '-k' or '--kiosk' option.  In this case, <b>Swarm</b> will 
		read the file (in the directory in which it was run) called 'SwarmKiosk.config'.  The format of this file is very simple, best demonstrated
		with an example file:<br>
		<pre>
# SwarmKiosk.config
# channel=[data source];[channel]{;optional options: x=[minutes],y=[hours]}

# Crater Peak Vertical
channel=AVO Winston;CRP_SHZ_AK;x=20,y=24

# Crater Peak East
channel=AVO Winston;CRP_SHE_AK;x=20,y=24
		</pre>
		The data source specified has to be one of the configured data sources (see <a href="sectionIX.html">Advanced Topics</a>, Swarm Configuration File).
