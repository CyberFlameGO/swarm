# Swarm

A Java application designed to display and analyze seismic waveforms in real-time. Swarm can connect to and read from a variety of different static and dynamics data sources, including Earthworm wave servers, IRIS DMCs, SEED and SAC files, and simple ASCII. Swarm has both time- and frequency-domain analysis tools, along with a mapping platform. A full-screen kiosk mode allows users to monitor incoming wave and helicorder data. Swarm was written by and for scientists and provides fine control over many different program settings and variables. The code is open source, freely available, and in the public domain.
