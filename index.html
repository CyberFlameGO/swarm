		<b><u>Introduction</u></b><br>
		<b>Swarm</b> is a program for the real-time analysis of seismic waveform data.  Currently it can load data from Earthworm Wave Servers and the under-development Winston system.<br>

		<br>
		This is a <b>beta</b> version of Swarm.  There are missing features, known bugs, and other limitations to this version.
		<br>
		Please email me bug reports or feature requests.  No bug report is too minor (such as a minor UI quirk).  My email address is:
		<a href="mailto:dcervelli@stanford.edu">dcervelli@stanford.edu</a><br>
		<br>
		The current version is: <b>1.1.12.20050425</b><br>
		<b>Important note #1: Channel names in Wave Servers (both WWS and Earthworm) are now space separated instead of underscore separated. This
		means that your SwarmGroups.config and SwarmKiosk.config files may need to change.</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>Important note #2: Version 1.1.12 fixes a bug that was causing Earthworm Wave Server data sources to not start in kiosk mode properly.</b><br> 
		<br>
		<b>Important note #3: We have now finalized the communication protocol for Winston Wave Servers (WWS) and there have been changes. 
		Consequently, version 1.1.10 will NO LONGER WORK with the pubavo1.wr.usgs.gov WWS.  Please upgrade to 1.1.12 immediately.</b><br>
		<br>
		Recent changes of note:<br>
		<b>Swarm</b> can access Winston Wave Servers.<br>
		<b>Swarm</b> can now read and write <b>SAC</b> files on the clipboard.<br>

		<br>
		<b>NOTE:</b> There have been some minor changes to the Swarm.config file so it is recommended that you do not reuse your old Swarm.config file.  I apologize for this and will make every effort to avoid changing formats in the future.<br>
		<br>
		A <a href="manual/appendixC.html">list of bug fixes and changes</a> can be found in Appendix C of the manual.<br>
		<br>

		<b><u>Installation</u></b><br>
		1.  Install Java Runtime Environment (or SDK) v1.4+.  Available at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/index.jsp</a><br>
		Note: The recently released Java 1.5 or (Java 5.0) can also be used to run Swarm.<br>
		<br>
		2.  Download Swarm.<br>
		zip: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~dcerv/swarm/swarm-bin.zip">http://www.stanford.edu/~dcerv/swarm/swarm-bin.zip</a><br>

		tar: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~dcerv/swarm/swarm-bin.tar.gz">http://www.stanford.edu/~dcerv/swarm/swarm-bin.tar.gz</a><br>
		<br>
		3.  Unzip or untar.  The program files are located under a directory called 'swarm' so it is safe to unzip wherever you like.<br>
		<br>
		4.  Run Swarm.  On Windows, simply run 'swarm.bat' in the 'swarm' directory.  On Unix-like platforms, run the 'swarm.sh' script.<br>
		<br>
		5.  Go through the <a href="manual/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.  This will quickly get you started using <b>Swarm</b>.<br>

		<br>
		
		<b><u>Notes and Issues</u></b><br>
		-- There is a manual included.  The starting point for the manual is the 'index.html' file under the 'swarm/manual' directory.
		The manual is also available <a href="manual/index.html">online</a>. <b>The manual is becoming a bit out of date
		and does not reflect all of the changes sinces version 1.1.4.</b><br>
